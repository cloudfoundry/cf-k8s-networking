## CF K8s Networking pipeline

The main pipeline for cf-k8s-networking has been moved into [cf-for-k8s ci](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s/blob/main/ci/pipelines/cf-k8s-networking.yml) and can be viewed [here](https://release-integration.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/cf-k8s-networking).

The remaining pipelines and tasks in the `ci` directory are left in this repo for historical purposes or have yet to be migrated over to [cf-for-k8s](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s).
