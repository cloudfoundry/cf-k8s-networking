# 4. Strategy for Securing Network Traffic

Date: 2020-01-23

## Status

Proposal

## Context

One of our [goals for networking in CF for Kubernetes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D12MZbZwVPSKmq97VNSNaoJbgUchM1xSC2VRIhXu7qU/edit) is to have all egress/ingress network traffic within the platform to be encrypted.

## Decision

We've identified three categories of sources/destinations:

* **External:** Traffic originating from/destined outside of the platform.
For example, the `cf cli` to Cloud Controller, web browsers to apps, UAA to off platform identity providers, etc.
* **Apps:** Unprivileged `cf push`-ed app workloads running on the platform.
For example, [dora](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests/tree/master/assets/dora).
* **System Components:** Cloud Foundry core services that implement power the platform.
For example, UAA, Cloud Controller, Log-Cache, etc.

We expect all of these components to want to communicate with each other in some fashion and we will leverage some existing Istio functionality to accomplish securing internal traffic.

See the following matrix:

| Source\Destination | External                                                                                                                      | Apps                                                                                                                                    | System Components                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| External           | N/A                                                                                                                           | Operator provides wildcard certs to Ingress Gateway.

### Istio Mesh mTLS
When we refer to "Istio Mesh mTLS" in the matrix above, we are assuming the following Istio functionality is leveraged:

* [Istio Auto mTLS](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/security/authentication/auto-mtls/)
* Have a default Istio mesh [policy](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/) that [sets the peer authentication method to mTLS](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/security/istio.authentication.v1alpha1/#PeerAuthenticationMethod) and sets the mTLS mode to `STRICT`. The [default is currently `STRICT`](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/security/istio.authentication.v1alpha1/#MutualTls) but we would like to explicitly set it in case the default changes.
* Istio [sidecar autoinjection](https://istio.io/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/) enabled

#### Footnotes

* 0 - System components that do not expect to receive traffic from apps could be protected using `NetworkPolicies` or Istio `AuthorizationPolicies`
* 1 - The exact mechanism for providing manually providing certificated to system components is to be determined.
* 2 -  Primary use case for system component to app communication that we can think of may be a platform managed Prometheus scraping apps' `/metrics` endpoints
